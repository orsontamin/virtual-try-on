⚠️ FIX FOR DRIVE PERMISSION ERROR

Your Google Apps Script has the code, but Google needs you to manually "Approve" the new Drive access once.

STEP 1: Trigger the Authorization Popup
1. Open your project at https://script.google.com
2. In the 'Code.gs' file, scroll down to the bottom.
3. Paste this temporary function:
   function triggerAuth() { DriveApp.getRootFolder(); }
4. In the top toolbar, select 'triggerAuth' from the dropdown.
5. Click the 'Run' button.
6. A popup will appear: "Authorization Required".
7. Click 'Review Permissions'.
8. Select your Google Account.
9. Click 'Advanced' > 'Go to [Project Name] (unsafe)'.
10. Click 'Allow'.

STEP 2: Update the Web App
1. After Step 1 finishes, click 'Deploy' > 'Manage Deployments'.
2. Click the 'Pencil' icon (Edit).
3. Select 'New Version'.
4. Click 'Deploy'.

The "Cloud Sync Failed" error will disappear immediately after these steps!
